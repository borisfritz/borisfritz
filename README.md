## 🛠️ Previous Experience

Before pursuing tech, I worked for a public works park department, where I became the go-to person for troubleshooting and maintaining systems around the city for the parks department. My experience included:

- Troubleshooting and solving unexpected issues quickly and efficiently  
- Maintaining and improving public parks and infrastructure  
- Collaborating with teams to coordinate projects and ensure smooth operations  

These experiences have given me a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork—all skills I’m excited to bring into the tech world!
