## 🧠 About Me

I was born in Nebraska and raised in Colorado. From 2016 to 2025, I lived in the California Bay Area, but I have recently moved back to Colorado to be closer to family.  

- 📸 **Outside of Work:**  
  - Amateur photographer (landscapes, wildlife, astrophotography)
  - Outdoor explorer (fishing, camping, hiking)
  - All things gaming (tabletop games, trading card games, PC gaming)
  - Avid sports fan! (Denver Broncos, San Francisco Giants, Vegas Golden Knights)

I’m always open to making friends with fellow tech enthusiasts. Don’t hesitate to reach out—whether you have a project idea, advice, or just want to chat about tech or photography!
